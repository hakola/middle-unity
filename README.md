# middle-unity
Simple puzzle game for mobile platforms. I have a prototype version running in Android. The .apk file is included in the MiddleTest folder.

Started making this when I got bored in a summer job. Worked quite intensively for a while. Project has been on hiatus 
for the last couple of months. 

Basic gameplay and menus have been implemented. Hoping to get a releasable version ready before summer.
I have uploaded a YouTube video showing the basic funtionality: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GbTU4pubg
